## g:Profiler

**Question**: What is the most significant GO:term? What is the p-value for this GO:term 

<img src="./IntegratedAssignment/images/gprofilerresultGO.png" alt="gprofilerresultGO.png" width="750" />

**Answer**: extracellular matrix organization


**Question**: Is this p-value already corrected for multiple testing? What type of correction is used for your current analysis? 

**Answer**: yes, it is already corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. I set the Significance threshold box to  "Benjaminin-Hochberg FDR". 


Re-run the analysis with User p-value threshold set to 0.0001. 

**Question**: What has been changed?

**Answer:** Only the gene-set with adjusted pvalue equal or less than 0.0001 are displayed. The list is reduced compared to the results obtained with the default settings. 

Ordered query: 

**Question**: Do you seen any changes in the output in comparison to the analysis of the unordered gene list (PART 2) 

**Answer** Although some terms are similar, their pvalues changed as well as the number of term genes used to calculate the pvalue.


**Question** What can you conclude about these networks? 

**Answer** The pathways are relevant to the biological model under study. The changes are related to the transformation of the epithelial cells into mesenchymal ones. 
  

## REACTOME FI

Pathway enrichment on the whole network. 

**Question** What is the pathway with the lowest (best) FDR? 

**Answer** The pathway with the lowest FDR is Endometrial cancer (K) with an FDR equal to 5.78w-16.

Cluster the network and perform pathway enrichment on the network.

**Question** How many clusters did the analysis retrieve?  

**Answer** The analysis retrieved 10 clusters named module 0 to module 9.

**Question** What is the FDR value of the most significant pathway of module 0?

**Answer** RAF/MAP kinase cascade (first row)

## GeneMANIA

**Question** What is the number of nodes in the CTNBB1 network.
